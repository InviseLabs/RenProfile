# RenProfile

A tool to rename the profile folder of your user account within Windows. Run from separate Admin account. **It recursively performs a `find and replace all` operation within the registry** – a method I developed for this specific purpose – in which it changes every mention of your old profile path to your new profile path. **Sounds dangerous, and it might be, but I tested this as working on Windows 11.**

Technically, there is no reason why this should cause any problems, except in poorly written programs that do not check the user account path use the relevent APIs, such as `%userprofile%`, or programs that later hard-code this path in a settings file – which no program should ever do. I suppose there will be some programmers out there that may follow bad practices for user profle path, but in my tests, this seems to be pretty rare now. Windows Server environments allow you to migrate user profiles, for example. In such events, it would likely be as easy as letting the program know the new path. **If RenProfile doesn't work or causes you problems, you can always reverse the changes you made by specifying the old user profile path as the new path and re-running the operation.**
