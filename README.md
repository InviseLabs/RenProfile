# RenProfile

A tool to rename the profile folder of your user account within Windows. Run from separate Admin account. It recursively performs a find and replace all operation in the registry – a method I developed for this specific purpose – in which it changes every mention of your old profile path to your new profile path. **Tested as working on Windows 11.**
